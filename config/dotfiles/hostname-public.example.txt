For machines behind a NAT router, checking the `hostname` command will always
report the LAN hostname. If an SSH client session originates outside of the LAN
I want the public hostname to be shown in the shell prompt. To do this:

Create a file named "hostname-public.txt" within this directory with the
contents being the public hostname for the machine.
